# merge-and-quick-sorts-for-different-sizes-of-n
Implementation of merge sort and quick sort for large numbers of n

The project consists of 1 .java file. 
tst.java is the sorting project which implements the merge sort and quick sort for large numbers of n such as 10000, 20000, 50000, etc. The numbers are chosen randomly.

This project was not created in a virtual environment. The java version used for this
project is as follows:
java 15.0.2 2021-01-19
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 15.0.2+7-27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 15.0.2+7-27, mixed mode, sharing)

To run the tests for tst.java, the different sizes of n is already provided inside the array n[]. It is not required to choose elements for the array as the fillArr(n) method already fills the array with positive random numbers from 1 to 1000000. To view the array elements before and after sorting, please uncomment the statements in the block comments /**/
